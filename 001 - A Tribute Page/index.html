      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Aziz Sancar was born in Savur in southeast Turkey in a lower middle
        class family (8 September 1946). His parents had no education but
        considered education important for their children. Sancar studied at
        Istanbul University and at the University of Texas, Dallas, where his
        received his doctorate in 1977. He is a professor at the University of
        North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill. Aziz Sancar is married
        to Gwen Boles Sancar who also is a professor in biochemistry and
        biophysics. <br /><br />
        Living cells have DNA molecules that carry an organism's genes. For the
        organism to live and develop, its DNA cannot change. DNA molecules are
        not completely stable, and they can be damaged. In 1983, through studies
        of bacteria, Aziz Sancar showed how certain protein molecules, certain
        repair enzymes, repair DNA damaged by ultraviolet (UV) light. These
        discoveries have increased our understanding of how the living cell
        works, the causes of cancer and aging processes.
