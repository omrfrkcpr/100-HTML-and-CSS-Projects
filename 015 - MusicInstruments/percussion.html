          There are various ingenious ways in which the marimba is designed to
          produce musical notes, including in places you cannot see, as well as
          through the length and thickness of the wood.

        <p>
          The timpani is an indispensable part of any orchestra, with its heavy
          bass sound that resonates deep in your abdomen. It is capable of
          producing accurate pitches, and can even be used to play a melody.

        <p>
          As the "keeper of the rhythm," the drum provides the foundation for
          the overall sound of music.Because a drum only has to be hit to make a
          sound, it is also one of the simplest of the instruments.
