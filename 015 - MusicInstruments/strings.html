        <p>
          The classical guitar can play a wide range of types of music-from
          classical music to bossa nova and jazz. Dubbed a mini-orchestra, the
          classical guitar covers an impressive range of timbres.

        <p>
          The timbre of a guitar is determined by its body. Most people have
          never looked inside a guitar and may not realize it, but guitars are
          actually very cleverly designed.

        <p>
          Even though electricity is used to amplify the volume, the body and
          neck are merely pieces of wood. These instruments come in unique
          shapes and colors.

          Whether performing an elegant solo or being the heart of the
          orchestra, the violin is a "star" in the music world.
