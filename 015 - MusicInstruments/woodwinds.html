        <p>
          A melodic instrument for the most part, the flute has a clear and
          bright sound with a distinctive warmth, refinement, and subtlety to
          its tone. Another feature of the flute is the use of expensive
          materials such as gold, silver, and gems in its manufacture.

        <p>
          The appeal of the clarinet is its rich variety of expression, which
          ranges from a light timbre to a deep mysterious timbre. It also boasts
          a register of approximately four octaves-the largest of any wind
          instrument.

        <p>
          The saxophone is an instrument with a tone somewhere between a brass
          instrument and a woodwind. The sax is a must in all types of music
          from jazz, to classical, to pop, when a smooth and bright sound is
          called for.

        />
        <p>
          Oboes, whose name comes from the French for "high-pitched wood," are
          excellent for solo performances with many notes in high ranges. The
          oboe is extremely difficult to play.

        <p>
          From deep resounding low notes to sweet melodies, unhindered
          expression. The long, wide wooden pipe of the bassoon contains much
          wisdom.

        <p>
          The recorder is familiar to most as the instrument used today in
          school lessons. However, its history extends to ancient times, and
          modern day performers are active in a wide range of settings.
